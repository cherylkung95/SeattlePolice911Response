## Summary
I analyze the Seattle 911 Police Incident Response dataset to see if there are any patterns between the time at the scene of an event, the specific type of event, and the characteristics of the location of the event.  The dataset was augmented by features from the US Census as well. The dataset was transformed for analysis by using unsupervised machine learning. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensions of the dataset, then the data as sorted using k-means clustering. The clusters were then manually analyzed for distinct variations.
